## Approach to Lectures

* Lectures are over Zoom
* Tuesday and Thursday (1pmET / 10amPT)
* Ask questions
* 2 hours long; break in the middle
* Right before break, we'll take attendance
* Don't write everything you see.. this will be provided after lecture
* Write down keywords / concepts you want to explore later
* Our lectures are a mix of theory and hands-on
* Focus on the approach:
    * Problem solving
    * Step-by-step problem breakdown
    * Error-driven development

## After a lecture...

* Don't expect to understand everything 100% day of delivery, takes time to digest and learn!
* Look for patterns you can repeat
* Repitition is key! Our activities help with this, if you feel you need more practice on a particular concept, make sure you do!
* If in-doubt, ask in Office Hours or an AR.

## Lectures are not...

* A time to work on your exercises...
* Code-along (don't type along with the instructor)

## Version Control

* git - Version control program we use on our computer!
* GitHub - Online web app. where we can store and manage repos.

What is, and why, version control?

* Can easily experiment/try and rollback!
* "Loading a previous save in a video game!"
* It can become disorganized and confusing to just create folders or "versions" manually!
* Rollback and explore the history of the project.
* If something breaks, we can rollback as part of the debugging process.

### These are the steps you'll carry out over and over while developing!

Best practice for commits is to create "atomic commits."

`git status` -> to check what has changed and current status

1. `git add path/to/file.extension`
2. `git commit -m "Add new file"`
3. `git push REMOTE_NAME BRANCH_NAME`; `git push origin main`

### Creating a new Repo

1. Start on your computer...
2. Start on GitHub...
